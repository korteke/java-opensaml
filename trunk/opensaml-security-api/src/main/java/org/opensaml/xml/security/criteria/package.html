Classes which model the abstract notion of a 'criteria'. Criteria are most often used as input to a 
{@link org.opensaml.xml.security.Resolver}.  Criteria are typically used by resolvers in an
resolver-specific manner to either lookup or extract information from a source,
or to constrain or filter the type of information that will be returned.
</p>
<p>
This package provides some implementations of {@link org.opensaml.xml.security.Criteria} which
may have general applicability throughout the library.  Criteria implementations which are more
specialized in nature may be found in other packages, such as {@link org.opensaml.xml.security.x509}.
