Interfaces and classes related to credentials and ways to represent
them.

Developers will generally create and populate CredentialResolvers
during application initialization time. CredentialCriteria can then be
constructured to model the information the application has about a
particular credential and then provided to the CredentialResolver in
order retrieve the previously loaded credential information. Here are a
couple of use cases where this approach might be used:
<ul>
	<li>An application wishes to decrypt a message from one of many
	peers. The encrypted message contains a KeyInfo which itself contains
	the public key used to encrypt the data. The application can then use
	the public key to lookup its appropriate private key and decrypt the
	message.</li>
	<li>An application uses client-cert authentication via TLS when
	communicating with a peer. Upon receipt of the peers certificate the
	application uses the provide entity certificate to lookup additional
	information associated with this credential, including CRLs, to
	determine if the credential should be trusted. It then looks up it's
	credential for the given peer and uses it to authenticate. Once
	completed the application stores the TLS session key in a
	CredentialResolver so that it may be used during encryption processes.
	</li>
</ul>
