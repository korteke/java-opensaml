/**
 * Implementation of {@link KeyInfoCredentialResolver} which resolves credentials based on a {@link KeyInfo} element
 * using a configured list of {@link KeyInfoProvider}'s and optional post-processing hooks.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The majority of the processing of the KeyInfo and extraction of {@link Credential}'s from the KeyInfo is handled by
 * instances of {@link KeyInfoProvider}. An ordered list of KeyInfoProviders must be supplied to the resolver when it
 * is constructed.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This resolver requires a {@link KeyInfoCriteria} to be supplied as the resolution criteria. It is permissible,
 * however, for the criteria's KeyInfo data object to be null. This allows for more convenient processing logic, for
 * example, in cases when a parent element allows an optional KeyInfo and when in fact a given instance does not contain
 * one. Specialized subclasses of this resolver may still attempt to return credentials in an implementation or
 * context-specific manner, as described below.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Processing of the supplied KeyInfo element proceeds as follows:
 * <ol>
 * <li>A {@link KeyInfoResolutionContext} is instantiated. This resolution context is used to hold state shared amongst
 * all the providers and processing hooks which run within the resolver.</li>
 * <li>This resolution context is initialized and populated with the actual KeyInfo object being processed as well as
 * the values of any {@link KeyName} child elements present.</li>
 * <li>An attempt is then made to resolve a credential from any {@link KeyValue} child elements as described for
 * {@link #resolveKeyValue(KeyInfoResolutionContext, CriteriaSet, List)} If a credential is so resolved, its key will
 * also be placed in the resolution context</li>
 * <li>The remaining (non-KeyValue) children are then processed in document order. Each child element is processed by
 * the registered providers in provider list order. The credential or credentials resolved by the first provider to
 * successfully do so are added to the effective set of credentials returned by the resolver, and processing of that
 * child element terminates. Processing continues with the next child element.</li>
 * <li>At this point all KeyInfo children have been processed. If the effective set of credentials to return is empty,
 * and if a key was resolved from a KeyValue element and is available in the resolution context, a basic credential is
 * built with that key and is added to the effective set. Since the KeyInfo may have a plain KeyValue representation of
 * the key represented by the KeyInfo, in addition to a more specific key type/container (and hence credential)
 * representation, this technique avoids the unnecessary return of duplicate keys, returning only the more specific
 * credential representation of the key.</li>
 * <li>A post-processing hook is then called: {@link #postProcess(KeyInfoResolutionContext, CriteriaSet, List)}. The
 * default implementation is a no-op. This is an extension point by which subclasses may implement custom
 * post-processing of the effective credential set to be returned. One example use case is when the KeyInfo being
 * processed represents the public aspects (e.g. public key, or a key name or other identifier) of an encryption key
 * belonging to the resolving entity. The resolved public keys and other resolution context information may be used to
 * further resolve the credential or credentials containing the associated decryption key (i.e. a private or symmetric
 * key). For an example of such an implementation, see {@link LocalKeyInfoCredentialResolver}</li>
 * <li>Finally, if no credentials have been otherwise resolved, a final post-processing hook is called:
 * {@link #postProcessEmptyCredentials(KeyInfoResolutionContext, CriteriaSet, List)}. The default implementation is a
 * no-op. This is an extension point by which subclasses may implement custom logic to resolve credentials in an
 * implementation or context-specific manner, if no other mechanism has succeeded. Example usages might be to return a
 * default set of credentials, or to use non-KeyInfo-derived criteria or contextual information to determine the
 * credential or credentials to return.</li>
 * </ol>
 * </p>
