XMLObject interfaces and helper classes for representing digitally signed content and signing/validating content.
<!-- Need to include links to Wiki documentation when available -->
<p/>
Those classes starting with XMLSec use the <a href="http://xml.apache.org/security/Java/index.html">Apache XML Security</a> library 
to provide their functionality.  Support for the JSR-105 will be added in the future.
