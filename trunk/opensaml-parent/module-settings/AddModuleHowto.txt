This document provides the steps necessary for a developer to add a new project
module.

The following steps should be performed from the command line, outside Eclipse.
All instances of "MODULE_NAME" should be replaced with whatever you call your
module.

1. Create a directory called opensaml-MODULE_NAME as a child of the java-opensaml
   project

2. With in the module directory create the directories:
   - src/main/java
   - src/main/resources
   - src/test/java
   - src/test/resources

3. Copy the java-opensaml/opensaml-part/module-settings/pom-template.xml in to 
   your module directory and edit the following lines:
   - line 14, replace "DESCRIPTIVE NAME" with a decently descriptive name
   - line 15, replace "MODULE_NAME"

4. Add (svn add java-opensaml/opensaml-MODULE_NAME) your module to SVN.
   
5. From the java-opensaml directory, run the following SVN command:
   svn propset svn:externals -F opensaml-parent/module-settings/externals.svn opensaml-MODULE_NAME
   
6. Commit (svn commit opensaml-MODULE_NAME -m "LOG MESSAGE") your module to SVN

7. Perform an svn update to pull in the externalized files (set up via step 5)

Now, from Eclipse

1. Within the package explore, right-click and select "Import"

2. Select "Maven 2 Project" as the project type

3. For the project location select your module via Browse

4. Import the module

At this point you should be good to go.

Some notes:
* The .checkstyle file or .settings directory are maintained centrally for all
modules.  So don't commit changes to them unless you really mean to change the
setting for all modules.

* The opensaml-parent/pom.xml declares both inherited and managed dependencies.
Inherited dependencies are inherited by, available to, all project modules. You
don't have to do anything in your pom to get them. Managed dependencies are 
managed (version, scope, exclusions, etc.) by the parent pom but are not 
automatically available to your project.  To use them your must declare a 
dependency with the a groupId, artifactId, and optionally a qualifier.  You do
not declare the version, scope, or exclusions (thats the managed part).

* If you have a dependency that is used by another module, define it as a 
managed dependency in the parent pom and change the other module's pom to use 
the dependency as a managed dependency.  In general, you should not declare 
additional inherited dependencies unless you're certain that every single 
project module will need it.
