/**
 * A configuration properties source implementation which obtains the properties set
 * from a {@link ThreadLocal} variable.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This supports use cases where applications with different configuration needs are sharing a classloader,
 * making usage of {@link ClasspathConfigurationPropertiesSource} inappropriate.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The thread-local properties instance is retrieved from {@link ThreadLocalConfigurationPropertiesHolder}.
 * An application-specific means must be used to populate this appropriately for each thread, taking care
 * to also clear it at the appropriate time (e.g. before the thread will be returned to a thread-pool
 * and re-used).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * For example, in a web application environment which uses Spring dependency injection, a servlet filter
 * would be used to obtain the Properties bean from the Spring web application context (via the servlet context),
 * and then populate the ThreadLocal via {@link ThreadLocalConfigurationPropertiesHolder#setProperties(Properties)},
 * making sure to then also clear it in a <code>finally</code> block after the filter chain has run via
 * {@link ThreadLocalConfigurationPropertiesHolder#clear()}.
