OpenSAML-J
=============================================

OpenSAML-J is a low-level library that allow developers to work with XML in a
Java beans manner.

OpenSAML-J requires working JAXP 1.3 and DOM Level 3 compliant parsers, 
which means if you are using Sun's JRE you will need to endorse JAXP compliant
libraries such as Xerces and Xalan.  OpenSAML, to date, has only been tested
on JDK 1.5 but support for 1.4 is planned for the final 1.0 release.

OpenSAML-J is licensed under the Apache License, version 2.
