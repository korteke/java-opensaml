The XMLTooling library provides the ability to work with XML as regular Java beans.  This is similar to 
the <a href="http://java.sun.com/webservices/jaxb/">Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB)</a>, 
<a href="http://xmlbeans.apache.org/">XMLBeans</a>, and <a href="http://xstream.codehaus.org/">XStream</a> libraries.
It differs from these libraries in three main ways:
<ul>
  <li>Much finer control to developer for what happens during the marshalling and unmarshalling processes</li>
  <li>Much more extensible, allowing various implementations of all of it's XMLObjects</li>
  <li>Support for XML Digital Signatures and Encryption</li>
</ul>
