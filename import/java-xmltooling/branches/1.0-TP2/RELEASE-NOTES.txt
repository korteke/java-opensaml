XMLTooling-J version 1.0 Technology Preview 2
=============================================

XMLTooling-J is a low-level library that may be used to construct libraries 
that allow developers to work with XML in a Java beans manner.

This technology preview is meant as an early release to allow developers to 
comment on the structure and APIs.  No guarantee about the stability of the
APIs are made; they will likely change.  This release should NEVER be used in a
production system.

XMLTooling-J requires working JAXP 1.3 and DOM Level 3 compliant parsers, 
which means if you are using Sun's JRE you will need to endorse JAXP compliant
libraries such as Xerces and Xalan.  XMLTooling, to date, has only been tested
on JDK 1.5 but support for 1.4 is planned for the final 1.0 release.
