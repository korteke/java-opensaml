/**
 * Specialized credential resolver interface which resolves credentials based on a {@link KeyInfo}  element.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This resolver requires a {@link KeyInfoCriteria} to be supplied as the resolution criteria.
 * It is permissible, however, for the criteria's KeyInfo to be null.  This allows for more
 * convenient processing logic for example when a parent element allows an optional KeyInfo
 * and in fact a given instance does not contain one.  Specialized subclasses of this resolver
 * may still attempt to return credentials in an implementation or context-specific manner,
 * as described below.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Most of the processing of the KeyInfo and extraction of {@link Credential}'s from the KeyInfo
 * is handled by instances of {@link KeyInfoProvider}.  An ordered list of KeyInfoProviders must be
 * supplied to the resolver when it is constructed.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Processing of the supplied KeyInfo element proceeds as follows:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>A {@link KeyInfoResolutionContext} is instantiated.  This resolution context is used to hold state shared
 *       amongst all the providers and processing hooks which run within the resolver.</li>
 *   <li>This resolution context is initialized and populated with the actual KeyInfo object being processed as
 *       well as the values of any {@link KeyName} child elements present.</li>
 *   <li>An attempt is then made to resolve a credential from any {@link KeyValue} child elements as described for
 *       {@link #resolveKeyValue(org.opensaml.xml.security.keyinfo.KeyInfoCredentialResolver.KeyInfoResolutionContext, CriteriaSet, List)}
 *       If a credential is so resolved, it will also be placed in the resolution context</li>
 *   <li>The remaining (non-KeyValue) children are then processed in document order.  Each child element is
 *       processed by the registered providers in provider list order. The credential or credentials resolved by the
 *       first provider to successfully do so are added to the effective set of credentials returned by the resolver,
 *       and processing of that child element terminates.  Processing continues with the next child element.</li>
 *   <li>At this point all KeyInfo children have been processed.  If the effective set of credentials to return 
 *       is empty, if a credential was resolved from a KeyValue element and available in the resolution context,
 *       it is added to the effective set. Since the KeyInfo may have a plain KeyValue representation of the key
 *       represented by the KeyInfo, in addition to a more specific key type/container (and hence credential)
 *       representation, this technique avoids the unnecessary return of duplicate keys, returning only the more
 *       specific credential representation of the key.</li>
 *   <li>A post-processing hook is then called: {@link #postProcess(org.opensaml.xml.security.keyinfo.KeyInfoCredentialResolver.KeyInfoResolutionContext, CriteriaSet, List)}.
 *       The default implementation is a no-op.  This is an extension point by which subclasses may implement custom
 *       post-processing of the effective credential set to be returned.  One example use case is when the KeyInfo
 *       being processed represents the public aspects (e.g. public key, or a key name or other identifier) of an
 *       encryption key belonging to the resolving entity.  The resolved public keys and other resolution context
 *       information may be used to further resolve the credential or credentials containing the associated decryption
 *       key (i.e. a private or symmetric key). For an example of such an implementation,
 *       see {@link LocalKeyInfoCredentialResolver}</li>
 *   <li>Finally, if no credentials have been otherwise resolved, a final post-processing hook is called: 
 *       {@link #postProcessEmptyCredentials(org.opensaml.xml.security.keyinfo.KeyInfoCredentialResolver.KeyInfoResolutionContext, CriteriaSet, List)}.
 *       The default implementation is a no-op.  This is an extension point by which subclasses may implement
 *       custom logic to resolve credentials in an implementation or context-specific manner, if no other
 *       mechanism has succeeded.  Example usages might be to return a default set of credentials,
 *       or to use non-KeyInfo-derived criteria or contextual information to determine the credential
 *       or credentials to return.</li>
 *   <li></li>
 * </ol>
 * </p>
