/**
 * An entity resolver that returns a dummy source to shortcut resolution
 * attempts.
 * 
 * During parsing, this should not be called with a systemId corresponding
 * to any known externally resolvable entity. It prevents "accidental"
 * resolution of external entities via URI resolution. Network based
 * retrieval of resources is NOT allowable and should really be something
 * the parser can block globally. We also can't return null, because that
 * signals URI resolution.
