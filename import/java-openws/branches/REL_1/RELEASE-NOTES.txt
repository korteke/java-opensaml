OpenWS-J Trunk
=============================================

The OpenWS library provides a growing set of tools to work with web services at 
a low level. These tools include classes for creating and reading SOAP messages, 
transport-independent clients for connecting to web services, and various 
transports for use with those clients.

This library requires working JAXP 1.3 and DOM Level 3 compliant parsers, 
which means if you are using Sun's JRE you will need to endorse JAXP compliant
libraries such as Xerces and Xalan.  This library, to date, has only been tested
on JDK 1.5 but support for 1.4 is planned for the final 1.0 release.
